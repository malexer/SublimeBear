SublimeBear plugin helps to integrate Sublime Text with [Bear](http://www.bear-writer.com) App for taking notes.

Currently only one command is supported: create note from the selected text.


Quick start
~~~~~~~~~~~

Call `Command Palette` and run command "Bear App: Create Note from selection".

The whole file will be used if nothing is selected.

You should be switched to Bear App with a new note created.
