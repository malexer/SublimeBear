# Sublime Bear

This plugin helps to integrate Sublime Text with [Bear App](http://www.bear-writer.com) for taking notes.

Currently only one command is supported: create note from the selected text.

# Install

Install using Package Control:

1. Package Control: Install Package
2. Select by name `Class Navigator`


# Usage

Select the text and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd>.
The whole file will be used if nothing is selected.

You should be switched to Bear App with a new note created.
